I see people forking this project and adding new features , but nobody is combining them in one . Guess what ?
I do it here so here we go , i am taking the features from all the following forks and combining them inside this repository + I fixed a serious bug for Windows 7 ( https://github.com/jezhumble/javasysmon/issues/35 ):
